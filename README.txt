Show custom fields with markup on frontend by shortcode

== Description ==

ACF Frontend Display helps you **show the value with the label of custom fields on the frontend** by shortcode.

In the *old way*, after creating the fields with Advanced Custom Fields, you must **go to the source code and call the field**. Now no more, **use the shortcode instead**

**How does it work?**

- **Show custom field value by field_name**, one by one, on frontend with shortcode [cats_field field="your_field_name"]
- **Show all custom field value of a group** on frontend at once [cats_field group_id="your_group_id" auto_loop="yes"]
- Exclude some fields on the loop [cats_field group_id="group_id" except="field1, field2" auto_loop="yes"]
